Linear search algorithm check every value in the list one by one and compare it with
the target value if the value is found it returns the index otherwise returns -1 or some other
special value

numbers = [5, 3, 4, 6, 9]

FUNCTION find_target(list, target)
    FOR index form 0 to LENGTH of list - 1
        IF list[index] == target
            RETURN the index
    RETURN -1

This will return 1 (which is the index at which the number is in the list)
find_target(numbers, 3)

This will return -1 (-1 means that the target is not found)
find_target(numbers, 7)
